\textbf{Demonstration Of Web Resources}\\
 Here are some of the most valuable online platforms widely used by students,
 teachers, and researchers in mathematics:\\
 • Mathematical Association of America (MAA):https://www.maa.org
 The MAAisdedicated to undergraduate-level mathematics. It offers jour
nals like *Math Horizons* and *The American Mathematical Monthly*,
 math competitions like the Putnam Exam, and various teaching resources.\\\\
 • American Mathematical Society (AMS): https://www.ams.org
 AMS supports research and scholarship in mathematics. It provides ac
cess to high-quality journals, MathSciNet (a database of mathematical
 reviews), conferences, and career resources.\\\\
 • Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM):https://www.siam.org
 SIAM focuses on applied and computational mathematics. It connects re
searchers working on real-world applications in science, engineering, and
 technology, and publishes several applied math journals.\\\\
 • arXiv.org (Preprint Repository): https://arxiv.org
 arXiv is a free distribution service and open-access archive where re
searchers upload preprints of their papers in mathematics, physics, com
puter science, and more. It’s often used for accessing cutting-edge research
 before peer review.\\\\
 • ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net
 ResearchGate is a professional network for scientists and researchers. Users
 can upload publications, ask questions, find collaborators, and track re
search metrics like citations and reads.
